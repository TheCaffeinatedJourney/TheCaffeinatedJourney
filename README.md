# The Caffeinated Journey ☕🏞️

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm on a never-ending journey fueled by caffeine, curiosity, and code. Here, you'll find a collection of projects that reflect my passions and interests!

### My Interests

- 🖥️ **Automation**: Making life easier with code. Simplifying workflows and introducing quality, consistency, and documentation into mundane or complex tasks.
- 📊 **Data**: Diving deep into data science, analytics, machine learning, and the art of data visualization.
- 🤖 **LLMs & AI**: Exploring the potential of large language models, artificial intelligence, and natural language processing.
- 💻 **Linux**: Living the terminal life with a focus on efficiency and power.
- 🏞️ **Homelab**: Experimenting with my own server setups, networking, and home automation.
- ☕ **Caffeine**: My coding companion. Every project is powered by a good brew!


### My Tools

My journey is powered by a variety of tools, languages, and frameworks. I'm always trying out new things, but here are some of the key technologies I regularly work with:

- **Bash**: My go-to for scripting and automation on Linux, from simple command-line tasks to complex system operations.
- **Python**: The backbone of my data projects and automation scripts. 
- **SQL**: Building, administering, and querying databases. Whether it's data storage, ETL pipelines, or data analysis, SQL is at the heart of my day-to-day work.
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent development environments and isolated project setups.  
- **Git**: You're here, so you know the drill... 
- **Linux**: My primary operating system where I tweak and automate everything. I use Arch with i3 for my daily driver, and primarily use Debian and its derivatives on my servers.
- **YAML & JSON**: For configuration management and data interchange.
- **HTML/CSS**: Basic web development for front-end needs, when creating static pages or simple interfaces.
